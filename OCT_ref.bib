   abstract = {Endoscopic diagnosis currently relies on the ability of the operator to visualize abnormal patterns in the image created by light reflected from the mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract. Advances in fiber optics, light sources, detectors, and molecular biology have led to the development of several novel methods for tissue evaluation in situ. The term "optical biopsy" refers to methods that use the properties of light to enable the operator to make an instant diagnosis at endoscopy, previously possible only by using histological or cytological analysis. Promising imaging techniques include fluorescence endoscopy, optical coherence tomography, confocal microendoscopy, and molecular imaging. Point detection schemes under development include light scattering and Raman spectroscopy. Such advanced diagnostic methods go beyond standard endoscopic techniques by offering improved image resolution, contrast, and tissue penetration and providing biochemical and molecular information about mucosal disease. This review describes the basic biophysics of light-tissue interactions, assesses the strengths and weaknesses of each method, and examines clinical and preclinical evidence for each approach.},

This chapter provides an overview and focuses on how the spectroscopy from key native molecules in tissues reveals the differences between cancerous and normal tissues of various organs due to morphological and molecular changes in the tissue. The key optical methods are: fluorescence, Stokes shift, elastic backscattering reflectance, Raman, and time-resolved spectroscopies. These will be reviewed as useful tools in optical biopsy. Various human tissue types (prostate, breast, lung, colon, and gastrointestinal) have been studied using optical biopsy.

Swept source optical coherence tomography has positively influenced and hugely contributed to the research of the vitreous body. It is the first ophthalmic diagnostic technology to demonstrate the entire structure of the posterior pre-cortical vitreous pocket (PPVP) <i>in vivo</i>. The roles of the PPVP in physiological posterior vitreous detachment and vitreoretinal interface disorders have now been elucidated. The presence of a connecting channel between the PPVP and Cloquet’s canal suggests that the aqueous humor drains into the premacular space. Deeper penetration of SS-OCT has made it possible to view the choroid. It also has an important role in central serous chorioretinopathy and uveitis. We have also been able to treat Harada disease by monitoring the choroidal thickness by SS-OCT.<br>},

In this paper, we propose an image processing technique using a planar motion model to address the problem. Unlike previous methods that involve complex 3-D feature correspondences, a simple approach to the analysis of inter-and intraframe distortions is presented. The high-resolution velocity estimates used for restoring the image are obtained by global motion estimation, Bézier curve fitting, and local motion estimation without resort to correspondence identification.

Due to the rolling shuttering mechanism of a CMOS sensor, a CMOS video frame shows CMOS distortions which are not observed in a CCD video frame, and previous video stabilization techniques cannot handle these distortions properly even though they can make a visually stable CMOS video sequence. In our proposed algorithm, we first suggest a CMOS distortion model. This model is based on a rolling shutter mechanism which provides a solution to solve the CMOS distortion problem. Next, we estimate the global image motion and the CMOS distortion transformation directly from the homography between CMOS frames. Using the two transformations, we remove CMOS distortions as well as jittering motions in a CMOS video. In the experimental results, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can handle the CMOS distortion problem more effectively as well as the jittering problem in a CMOS video compared to previous CCD-based digital image stabilization techniques. © 2007 IEEE.},

It takes advantage of the image deformations induced by rolling shutter in CMOS image sensors. First of all, after analysing the rolling shutter phenomenon, we introduce an original model of the image formation when using such a camera, based on a general model of moving rigid sets of 3D points. Using 2D-3D point correspondences, we derive two complementary methods, compensating for the rolling shutter deformations to deliver an accurate 3D pose and exploiting them to also estimate the full 3D velocity. The first solution is a general one based on non-linear optimization and bundle adjustment, usable for any object, while the second one is a closed-form linear solution valid for planar objects. The resulting algorithms enable us to transform a CMOS low cost and low power camera into an innovative and powerful velocity sensor. Finally, experimental results with real data confirm the relevance and accuracy of the approach. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

In medical purposes, OCT images are generally called optical biopsies which allows in-vivo investigation almost similar to a histopathological study. The physician can rely on the OCT images to establish a rapid and direct diagnosis. But the OCT images formation suffered numerous distortions due in particular to the optical path, from the source to the viewed sample passing through the two reflecting mirrors and a scan objective. The obtained optical biopsies include several spectral and geometric distortions. The proposed calibration model aims to compensate the geometrical ones. More precisely, two models were developed allowing the correction of both 2D images (B-Scan slices) and 3D images (volume). These models were experimentally validated (in both artificial and biological samples) using a spectral domain OCT system. It has demonstrated a significant enhancement of the OCT images accuracy.},

Recently OCT has found its applications in blood flow estimation, cancer diagnosis, dermatology, dentistry, gastroenterology and other non-biomedical applications. For this purpose simulation of OCT has been done using Lab VIEW and Matlab scripts. Spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) which is recent modification to traditional time domain OCT systems and has advantage of faster signal acquisition rates and higher signal to noise ratio. The basic principle of OCT, its types, modeling and its simulation on Virtual OCT GUI and various results obtained from it have been discussed.},

   abstract = {It has been shown that transversal scanning (or en-face) optical coherence tomography (TS-OCT) represents an imaging modality capable to record high isotropic resolution images of the human retina in vivo. However, axial eye motion still remains a challenging problem of this technique. In this paper we introduce a novel method to compensate for this eye motion. An auxiliary spectral domain partial coherence interferometer (SD-PCI) was integrated into an existing TS-OCT system and used to measure accurately the position of the cornea. A light source emitting at 1310nm was used in the additional interferometer which enabled a nearly loss free coupling of the two measurement beams via a dichroic mirror. The recorded corneal position was used to drive an additional voice coil translation stage in the reference arm of the TS-OCT system to correct for axial eye motion. Currently, the correction can be performed with an update rate of ~200Hz. The TS-OCT instrument is operated with a line scan rate of 4000 transversal lines per second which enables simultaneous SLO/OCT imaging at a frame rate of 40fps. 3D data of the human retina with isotropic high resolution, that was sufficient to visualize the human cone mosaic in vivo, is presented.},

   abstract = {Objective: To determine whether multiple B-scan averaging improves the quality of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT) images of the retina. Design: Prospective cross-sectional study. Participants: One hundred one eyes of 84 patients with various retinal diseases. Methods: A prototype SD OCT system was used with a sensitivity of 98 decibels, air axial resolution of 6.1 μm, and acquisition rate of approximately 18 700 axial scans per second. To evaluate multiple B-scan averaging, a set of 12 B-scan images was obtained at the identical retinal location and the multiple scans were averaged using custom software; some images containing lateral eye motion were rejected. Objective differences in image quality were measured by comparing the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) for key retinal structures in unenhanced and enhanced images using non-repeated-measures analysis of variance and the Dennett post hoc test. Subjective differences in image quality were evaluated by asking trained ophthalmologists independently to rank pairs of unenhanced and enhanced SD OCT images on a 5-point scale (upper or lower image definitely better, slightly better, or equal) and analyzing results using the Scheffe method for paired comparisons. Main Outcome Measures: Contrast-to-noise ratio in enhanced versus unenhanced SD OCT images, expert comparison of image quality, and retinal pathologic features in enhanced versus unenhanced SD OCT images. Results: Averaging >4 SD OCT scans achieved significant improvement in CNR and also improved ophthalmologists' ability to distinguish retinal structures. More than 4 scans could be averaged for 100 (99 \%) of the 101 eyes with retinal diseases in this study. Averaging >4 SD OCT scans improved visualization of structures, such as abnormalities in the photoreceptor layer and sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) lesions, that could not be identified clearly in single-scan SD OCT images because of various retinal pathologic features. These included intraretinal lesions that mask the underlying structures, such as cystoid macular edema and retinal hemorrhage, and inward shifting of the sensory retina because of pigment epithelial detachment and lesions beneath the RPE. Conclusions: Multiple B-scan averaging is an easy and practical method to improve the quality of retinal images obtained by SD OCT and thereby to improve the diagnosis and management of retinal diseases. © 2008 American Academy of Ophthalmology.},

@article{Zawadzki2007,
   abstract = {The ability to obtain true three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the retinal structures is essential for future clinical and
experimental studies. It becomes especially critical if the measurements acquired with different instruments need to be
compared, or precise volumetric data are needed for monitoring and treatment of retinal disease. On the other hand, it is
well understood that optical coherence tomography (OCT) images are distorted by several factors. Only limited work has
been performed to eliminate these problems in ophthalmic retinal imaging, perhaps because they are less evident in the
more common 2D representation mode of time-domain OCT. With recent progress in imaging speed of Fourier domain -
OCT (Fd-OCT) techniques, however, 3D OCT imaging is more frequently being used, thereby exposing problems that
have been ignored previously. In this paper we propose possible solutions to minimize and compensate for artifacts
caused by subject eye and head motion, and distortions caused by the geometry of the scanning optics. The first is
corrected by cross-correlation based B-scan registration techniques; the second is corrected by incorporating the
geometry of the scanning beam into custom volume rendering software. Retinal volumes of optical nerve head (ONH)
and foveal regions of healthy volunteer, with and without corrections, are presented. Finally, some common factors that
may lead to increased distortions of the ophthalmic OCT image such as refractive error or position of the subject's head
are discussed.},

   abstract = {This paper reviews the current state of research in spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT). SDOCT is an interferometric technique that provides depth-resolved tissue structure information encoded in the magnitude and delay of the back-scattered light by spectral analysis of the interference fringe pattern. There are two approaches to SDOCT--one that uses a broadband source and a spectrometer to measure the interference pattern as a function of wavelength and the other that utilizes a narrowband tunable laser that is swept linearly in k approximately 1/lambda space during spectral fringe data acquisition. Unlike time domain (TD) OCT, the reference arm is stationary in both SDOCT methods, which allows for ultra high-speed OCT imaging. Owing to its high speed and superior sensitivity, SDOCT has become indispensable in biomedical imaging applications. After a brief introduction and a discussion on sensitivity advantage, methods of implementation of the two SDOCT schemes will be presented. The two peer approaches are compared in speed, scan depth range, complexity, spectral regions of operation, and methods of detection. The review also discusses OCT enhancements and functional methods based on SDOCT format and concludes with possible directions that this research may take in the near future.},
