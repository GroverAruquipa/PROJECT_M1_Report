abstract = {The past few years we have witnessed an increase in the development of IoT concept. This concept entails the connection of objects that surround us in our everyday life to Internet. This paradigm where the human users are replaced by objects determines the appearance of different problems that are related to: scalability of the systems and sensors, power supply management techniques that must allow the sensor to operate for years and even decades and longer communication range suitable for urban non-LoS. LoRa modulation among the LoRaWAN communication protocol is regarded as a problem solver. In this paper, we present the development and the design of a LoRa traffic generator that has the ability of generating a high volume of traffic. This approach allows for the emulation of large scale LoRaWAN networks without the need of additional costs. Thus, the scalability and the reliability of LoRa networks can be researched and studied in detail. From the obtained results the LoRa traffic generator ensures a high level of performance and can be used for future improvements of LoRa communication.},

abstract = {In recent years, nano satellite has gained popularity among students and young researchers. The reason is that, nano satellite has the ability similar to larger satellite, but in tiny compact size. It is easy to made and can be made using low cost devices. However the main problem in making a nano satellite is in the its communication system. Nano satellite communication system has to be reliable to send information from ground station to nano satellite or vice versa. In this paper, we propose a nano satellite communication system using Raspberry Pi, and a HackRF SDR which is programmed using GNURadio. From the testing process, the text data can be transmitted properly from ground station to nano satellite using GMSK modulation scheme. This communication system also has ability to be reconfigured, which means many modulation scheme and algorithm can be implemented easily without changing the hardware.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020 SPIE The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has significantly hindered the functioning of universities. The necessity to work remotely has disabled access to the hardware laboratories. In the teaching of embedded systems, the possibility of working with real hardware is really important. Fortunately, the embedded computer system itself may be efficiently emulated with QEMU. However, the problem may arise with the emulation of its environment, the I/O devices, especially those providing the user interface. This paper describes the methods to modify and use QEMU to emulate the real hardware used in the laboratories. It also discusses the advantages and limitations of such an approach. The elaborated methodology may be useful also after the pandemic, to support and improve teaching in normal conditions, e.g., by allowing students to perform at home the realistic experiments on emulated hardware.},

It was launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) on December 18th 2019 and is open to European academia and industry allowing new concepts to be tested in space with a range of interesting payloads. This paper discusses the implementation and results of an In-Orbit Demonstration (IOD) using the Software Defined Radio (SDR) payload of OPS-SAT together with on-board RF Processing techniques. We demonstrate the design of a software configurable Search and Rescue receiver using GNU Radio, running on Linux in a 3U CubeSat. The system runs on the Satellite Experimental Processing Platform (SEPP) Cyclone V ARM System-on-Chip and is able to autonomously detect and decode transmissions from terrestrial 406 MHz beacons from the global COSPAS-SARSAT Search and Rescue system. Decoded beacon information is logged on-board together with metadata and is downloaded to Mission Control (MC) at ESA/ESOC. The successful IOD paves the way for in-orbit RF experimentation and bridges the gap between satellite operations and the IoT era.},

Abstract The Educational Irish Research Satellite (EIRSAT-1) is a student-led project to design, build and test Ireland's first satellite. As part of the development, a ground segment (GS) has also been designed alongside the spacecraft. The ground segment will support two-way communications with the spacecraft throughout the mission. Communication with the satellite will occur in the very high frequency (VHF) and the ultra high frequency (UHF) bands for the uplink and downlink respectively. Different modulation schemes have been implemented for both uplink and downlink as part of the GS system. Uplink incorporates an Audio Frequency Shift-Keying (AFSK) scheme, while downlink incorporates a Gaussian Minimum Shift-Keying (GMSK) scheme. In order for the spacecraft to successfully receive a telecommand (TC) transmitted from the ground station, a framing protocol is required. AX.25 was selected as the data link layer protocol. A hardware terminal node controller (TNC) executes both the AX.25 framing and the AFSK modulation. Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS) framing software was developed to allow data to be accepted by the TNC. A software defined radio (SDR) approach has been chosen for the downlink. GNURadio is software that allows flowcharts to be built to undertake the required signal processing of the received signal, the demodulation of the signal and the decoding of data. This paper provides a detailed account of the software developed for the ground segment communication system. A review of the AX.25 and KISS framing protocols is presented. The GNURadio flowcharts that handle the signal processing and data decoding are broken down and each constituent is explained. To ensure the reliability and robustness of the system, a suite of tests was undertaken, the results of which are also presented.},
